## Introduction

**Projects** in PowerUX are designed to help organize your custom business logic and streamline the way solution-aware components are added to your Dataverse solutions. By aligning with how your organization structures its ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) processes, Projects ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability.

With Projects, **solution architects** define clear solution-mapping rules, while **makers** can focus purely on building logic using PowerUX, without worrying about where components are deployed.

## Create a project

To create a new project:

1. Navigate to **Projects** from the left-hand menu in the PowerUX app.\

2. Click on **New**.
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: A descriptive title for your project.
   - **Description**: A summary of what the project is about.
   - **URL** _(optional)_: A reference link to the associated DevOps board, Jira board, or any project tracker.
4. **Default Solution**: Select the primary unmanaged solution. All components generated by PowerUX under this project will be automatically added to this solution, unless overridden by more specific rules.\

5. Click **Save** to create the project.

## Project Solution Maps

For more granular control over where components go, PowerUX offers **Project Solution Maps**.

These allow solution architects to define advanced rules that automatically direct PowerUX-generated components to specific Dataverse solutions, based on criteria such as:

- The **table** the logic is related to.
- A **specific form** within that table.

This ensures components are routed correctly without manual intervention, contributing to a clean and structured ALM process.

#### Adding a Solution Map Rule

Once your project is saved:

1. Scroll to the **Project Solution Maps** subgrid on the project form.\

2. Click **Create New**.
3. Fill in the rule details:
   - **Name**: Name of the rule.
   - **Table**: The Dataverse table to target.
   - **Form** _(optional)_: The specific form under the selected table, if the rule should apply only there.
   - **Solution**: The unmanaged solution where the components should be added.
4. Click **Create** to save your rule.

## Adding a UX flow to a project

While you're on the UX Flow form, you can select a project to relate the UX flow to:
