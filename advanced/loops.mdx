You can loop over an array of items through the "**For Loop**" step or other looping steps, such as `Get Records` API.

To set up a loop action, follow these steps:

1. Click on the toggle list to select the variable you want to iterate over.

2. Click the + button on the branch with the loop sign to select the action step you want to perform on each item in the array.

  Tip: for steps inside the for loop, to refer to the current item using intelliSense you can use `@Item` which will refer to the current item of the looped array
