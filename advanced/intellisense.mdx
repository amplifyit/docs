The **IntelliSense** feature in PowerUX enhances the maker experience by providing real-time suggestions and auto-completions when working with dynamic values. It simplifies referencing system variables, control properties, and dynamic attributes, reducing errors and speeding up development.

With IntelliSense, makers can easily access:

* **Presets of system variables** (e.g., user details, app metadata)

* **Dynamic values from attributes** (e.g., page data, selected items)

* **Control properties and values** (e.g., button text, form inputs)

This feature ensures a more efficient and intuitive workflow by automatically surfacing relevant options as makers build their applications.

<Info>
  Unknown sub items of a certain IntelliSense object, like a variable object, a retrieved record, or an item in a for loop, you can directly type the logical name of the parameter or the attribute from the logic. For example:&#x20;
  `@Variables.RetrievedContact.firstname`

  `@Item.new_name`
