description: "This page provides an overview of different types of variables that can be used in a flow, and how to initialize and set them. Variables allow you to maintain and manipulate data throughout your flow, and can hold values. By initializing and setting variables, you can create more complex and dynamic flows that respond to changing conditions and user inputs."
