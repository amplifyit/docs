<Frame>
  ![Genai Create New Desc Pn](/images/genai-create-new-desc.png)
</Frame>

**Write a clear description** of what you want your flow to do. For example:

```
When the form loads, show a notification if the record name contains Test
```

<Note>
  Be specific about:

  - **When** it should happen (trigger)
  - **What** it should do (actions)
  - **Conditions** if any (logic)
</Note>

### Step 5: Configure Flow Properties

After describing your flow, set the standard flow properties:

<ParamField path="Flow Name" type="string" required>
  A descriptive name for your flow
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Description" type="string">
  Brief description of what the flow does (optional but recommended)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Table" type="dropdown" required>
  Select the table this flow operates on
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Form" type="dropdown" required>
  Select the form for this flow (for Form flows)
</ParamField>

### Step 6: Create Your Flow

Click the **Create** button. PowerUX AI will:

1. Analyze your natural language description
2. Determine the required action steps
3. Configure the proper logic and conditions
4. Generate a complete, ready-to-use flow

## Writing Effective AI Prompts

The quality of your AI-generated flow depends on how clearly you describe your requirements. Follow these best practices:

### Be Specific About Triggers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Good Trigger Descriptions" icon="check">
    - "When the form loads"
    - "When the user clicks the Save button"
    - "When the Status field changes"
    - "On form load, after data is loaded"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Vague Triggers" icon="xmark">
    - "Sometimes do this"
    - "When needed"
    - "Usually when..."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Describe Clear Actions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Good Action Descriptions" icon="check">
    - "Show a notification with the message 'Record saved successfully'"
    - "Hide the Credit Limit field"
    - "Set the Status field to 'Active'"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Ambiguous Actions" icon="xmark">
    - "Do something with the field"
    - "Update stuff"
    - "Handle the record"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Include Conditions Clearly

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Good Condition Descriptions" icon="check">
    - "If the Account Type equals 'Enterprise'"
    - "When the record name contains 'Test'"
    - "If the Annual Revenue is greater than 1000000"
    - "When the Status is not 'Active' and Priority is 'High'"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Unclear Conditions" icon="xmark">
    - "If it's the right type"
    - "When appropriate"
    - "If needed"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example AI Prompts

### Simple Notification

**Prompt:**

```
When the form loads, show a notification if the record name contains Test
```

**What AI Creates:**

- Form OnLoad trigger
- Condition checking if Name contains "Test"
- Form notification action with an appropriate message

---

### Field Visibility Control

**Prompt:**

```
When the Account Type field changes, hide the Credit Limit field if the 
type is not Enterprise, otherwise show it
```

**What AI Creates:**

- Field OnChange trigger for Account Type
- Branching condition based on field value
- Show/Hide control actions for Credit Limit field

---

### Data Validation

**Prompt:**

```
When the user clicks Save, check if the email field has a valid email format. 
If not, show an error on the field and prevent saving
```

**What AI Creates:**

- Form OnSave trigger
- Email validation logic
- Error display on field
- Cancel save action if invalid

---

### Automated Record Creation

**Prompt:**

```
When the form saves and the Status is changed to Won, automatically create 
a new Task record assigned to the owner with subject "Follow up on opportunity"
```

**What AI Creates:**

- Form OnSave trigger
- Condition checking Status change
- Create Record action with proper field mappings
- Success notification

---

### Complex Business Logic

**Prompt:**

```
On form load, if the user is a System Administrator, show all fields. 
If the user is a Sales Rep, hide the Cost Price and Margin fields. 
For all other users, make the form read-only and show a warning notification
```

**What AI Creates:**

- Form OnLoad trigger
- Multiple branching conditions based on user roles
- Field visibility controls for each scenario
- Form mode changes
- Conditional notifications

## Advanced AI Prompt Techniques

### Use Context from Multiple Fields

**Prompt:**

```
When Annual Revenue is greater than $5M and Account Type is Enterprise 
and Credit Hold is false, automatically set the Credit Limit to the 
Annual Revenue multiplied by 0.2
```

The AI understands multi-field relationships and creates appropriate logic.

### Specify Complex Workflows

**Prompt:**

```
When the form saves:
1. If Status changed to Complete, set the send email flag to yes
2. Show a success notification
```

The AI creates a sequential flow with all steps in the correct order.

## Reviewing and Refining AI-Generated Flows

After AI generates your flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the Flow">
    Examine the generated action steps in the flow builder
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Logic">
    Use the Preview feature to test different scenarios
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine if Needed">
    Modify any action steps to better match your specific requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Details">
    Enhance with additional error handling or user feedback
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    When satisfied, publish your flow to production
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  AI-generated flows are a great starting point. You can always modify them to add more sophisticated logic or handle edge cases.
</Tip>

## Tips for Best Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Then Iterate" icon="seedling">
    Begin with a basic description and let AI create the flow. Then, if needed, create a new version with more details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Field Names Correctly" icon="tag">
    Reference fields by their display names as they appear in the form (e.g., "Account Name" not "accountname").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be Sequential" icon="list-ol">
    If you have multiple actions, describe them in the order they should occur. Use numbered lists when helpful.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Specify User Experience" icon="user">
    Describe the user experience you want: "show a notification", "display an error", "prompt for confirmation".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Use Cases

### Conditional Field Visibility

```
When the form loads, hide the Discount field if the Account Type 
is not Premium or VIP
```

### Dynamic Field Requirements

```
When the Opportunity Stage changes to Proposal, make the 
Budget Amount and Close Date fields required
```

### Calculated Fields

```
When Quantity or Unit Price changes, calculate and set the 
Total Amount to Quantity multiplied by Unit Price
```

### User Notifications

```
When the form loads, if this is a high-priority case that hasn't 
been updated in 48 hours, show an urgent warning notification
```

### Record Status Management

```
When Save is clicked, if all required fields are filled and the 
Status is Draft, automatically change Status to Ready for Review
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flow doesn't do what I expected">
    **Solution**: Review the generated flow in the builder. The AI might have interpreted your description differently. Modify the action steps or try rephrasing your description.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Some fields are not found">
    **Solution**: Ensure you're using the exact display names of fields as they appear in your form. Check spelling and capitalization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Logic is too simple or too complex">
    **Solution**: Adjust the detail level in your description. More detail = more complex flows. Less detail = simpler flows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Need to combine multiple scenarios">
    **Solution**: Either describe all scenarios in one prompt, or create separate flows for each scenario and combine them manually.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
