## ðŸš€ Enhanced Backend Code Generation

We're excited to announce PowerUX v0.3.0.0, featuring significant improvements to our backend code generation system that make script updates safer and more efficient.

### âœ¨ What's New

#### Smart Script Updates

- **Selective Flow Updates**: PowerUX now intelligently updates individual UX flows within existing scripts instead of regenerating entire scripts
- **Safe Flow Removal**: Disable flows by cleanly removing their contents from scripts while preserving other published flows
- **Preservation of Existing Flows**: Already published UX flows remain untouched during updates, reducing risk of unintended changes

#### Performance Improvements

- **Faster Publishing**: Dramatically improved performance for the flow publishing process
- **Reduced Processing Time**: Selective updates mean less code generation overhead
- **Optimized Resource Usage**: More efficient backend operations with targeted script modifications

### ðŸ”§ Technical Enhancements

The new backend code generation system introduces:

- **Granular Script Management**: Target specific flows for updates without affecting the entire script ecosystem
- **Enhanced Safety Protocols**: Minimize risk of breaking existing functionality during updates

### ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

- **Reduced Risk**: Safer updates that don't interfere with existing published flows
- **Improved Efficiency**: Faster publishing cycles with selective code generation
- **Better Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns between different UX flows
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: More predictable and reliable script management
