## 🧩 New Feature: Projects

You can now create and manage **Projects** inside PowerUX\!

Each project lets you:

- Set a **default solution**
- Define **solution-to-project maps** using customizable rules
- Automatically manage deployment of UX Flows and scripts

When you **create or update** a UX Flow, PowerUX will:

✅ Automatically add scripts

✅ Add the related form

✅ Push everything into one or more solutions based on your project rules

No more manual deployment steps, just build, update, and ship\!

## 🚀 New Action Steps

### 🆕 In-App Notifications

Show interactive notifications directly inside your app. Designed to improve UX without relying on native browser alerts.

### 🆕 Attribute Fire On Change

Programmatically trigger an `onChange` event on any field — ideal for workflows that rely on calculated fields or business logic triggers.

### 🆕 Wait

Introduce a timed delay within your flow. Great for smoothing transitions or spacing out actions.

### 🆕 Global App Notification

Display a notification banner across the app with:

- User-dismiss functionality
- Optional auto-hide after a custom number of seconds

## ✏️ Updated Action Steps

### ⏱️ Timed Form Notifications

Form notifications now support **auto-hide** timers\!

When adding a new notification step, you can set how many seconds the message should stay visible before disappearing.

<Warning>
  **Important:** This setting is available **only** for newly added steps. If you're updating an existing notification, delete and re-add the step to see the new timer option.
</Warning>
