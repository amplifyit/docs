## üöÄ New Features

### Templates for UX Flows

Create UX Flows faster with our new pre-built template system. This initial release includes templates for:

- Forms
- Command bars UX flows

More templates will be added in future releases to expand your workflow creation options.

### MatchRegex Boolean Function

A new boolean function has been added to enhance text validation capabilities:

- **MatchRegex**: Returns true/false based on whether text matches a specified regular expression pattern
- Enables makers to implement sophisticated text format validation in their flows

## ‚ö° Enhancements

### Improved Error Handling for Web Resource Deletion

Enhanced error messaging when web resource deletion fails due to:

- Existing dependencies
- Ongoing publish requests

Error messages are now more descriptive and actionable, helping you quickly identify and resolve deletion issues.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Custom Handlers Management

- **Fixed**: Removing custom handlers now properly removes custom triggers
- **Previously**: Makers had to manually remove triggers from forms and delete web resources
- **Now**: Complete cleanup is handled automatically

### UX Flow Validation Improvements

- **Fixed**: Unique name validation now scopes to the same table instead of all flows
- **Benefit**: Allows reuse of flow names across different tables while maintaining uniqueness where needed

### Publishing and Disabling Flow Operations

- **Fixed**: Publishing or disabling flows during active customization processes
- **Previously**: Operations would fail and continue running in background
- **Now**: Operations are blocked until current publish request completes, requiring manual re-initiation

### For Loop Intellisense Enhancement

- **Fixed**: Item intellisense now properly appears within For Loop step actions
- **Benefit**: Improved development experience with better code completion

### Roles Intellisense Fix

- **Fixed**: Roles now return as an array instead of a collection
- **Previously**: Roles collection couldn't be looped over, causing failures
- **Now**: Makers can properly configure loops over role arrays

### Project Solution Mapping

- **Fixed**: UX flow to project relationships now work with default solutions
- **Previously**: Flows failed when related to projects without solution mapping
- **Now**: Supports all project configurations including default solutions

### Lookup Tag Custom Trigger Scripts

- **Fixed**: Script execution for lookup tag custom triggers
- **Applies to**: Both minified and unminified scripts
- **Previously**: Scripts failed when triggers occurred
- **Now**: Reliable execution in all scenarios
