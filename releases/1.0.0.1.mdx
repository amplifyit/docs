## üöÄ Major Features

### 1. Reusable Functions

Create modular, reusable UX flows that can be called across multiple forms and command bars, dramatically improving maintainability and reducing duplication.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Function Library**: Build a centralized repository of reusable business logic
- **Cross-Flow Integration**: Use custom functions in any Form or Command Bar flow
- **Template Support**: Start with pre-built templates or create from scratch
- **AI-Assisted Creation**: Generate functions using natural language prompts
- **Parameter Passing**: Define inputs and outputs for flexible function calls
- **Version Control**: Track and manage function versions independently

**How to Create a Function:**

1. Click **New Flow** ‚Üí **Function**
2. Choose creation method:
   - Start with a **Template**
   - Use **AI** to generate from natural language
   - Start with a **Blank** canvas
3. Configure function parameters and logic
4. Click **Publish**

**How to Use a Function:**

1. Open any Form or Command Bar flow
2. Click **Edit** to enter the UI Editor
3. Add a new step
4. Navigate to the **Functions** tab
5. Select your custom function
6. Configure inputs and click **Publish**

### 2. AI-Powered Flow Generation

Transform natural language descriptions into fully functional UX flows with AI-assisted drafting.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Natural Language Input**: Describe what you want in plain English
- **Intelligent Flow Construction**: AI generates complete flow logic automatically
- **Smart Field Mapping**: Automatic detection and mapping of entity fields
- **Context-Aware Actions**: AI understands business context and selects appropriate actions
- **Draft Mode**: Review and modify AI-generated flows before publishing
- **Learning System**: AI improves suggestions based on your metadata and patterns

**How to Generate Flows with AI:**

1. Click **New Flow** ‚Üí Select flow type (Form, Command Bar, or Function)
2. Choose **Create with AI**
3. Enter your requirements in natural language:
   - _"When the opportunity amount exceeds \$100,000, send a notification to the sales manager and mark it as high priority"_
   - _"If the case priority is high and no owner is assigned, assign it to the support team queue"_
   - _"Calculate the total project cost by summing all related task estimates"_
4. Review the generated flow in the UI Editor
5. Make any adjustments or refinements
6. Click **Publish** when ready

**AI Prompt Examples:**

- _"Create a flow that validates phone numbers and shows an error if the format is incorrect"_
- _"When a lead is qualified, create an opportunity and copy over key fields like estimated value and close date"_
- _"Set the account status to active if all required fields are filled and approved"_

- **Method Completion**: Accurate completion for getValue(), getName(), and other SDK methods
- **Type Safety**: Improved type checking for field references and operations

### Runtime Engine

- **Optimized Execution**: Faster flow execution with improved JavaScript generation
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when actions fail

---

## üìö Documentation & Resources

### New Documentation

- **Reusable Functions Guide**: Complete guide to creating and using functions
- **AI Flow Generation Tutorial**: Step-by-step walkthrough of AI-assisted flow creation

---

## üîÑ Breaking Changes

**None** - This release maintains backward compatibility with all beta versions.

All existing flows will continue to work without modifications. However, we recommend reviewing your flows to take advantage of new features like reusable functions.

---

## üìã Known Limitations

- Custom Functions might have issue when flows are published, content might be in one line or might be commented out as well.
- Dragging and dropping trees of actions makes the steps in the UI editor overlap each other.

---

## üéØ Migration Notes

### From Beta Versions

1. **No action required** - All existing flows are compatible
2. **Optional**: Review flows to identify candidates for conversion to reusable functions
3. **Recommended**: Try AI generation for new flows to experience productivity gains
4. **Consider**: Refactoring complex flows using the new function architecture

### New Installations

- PowerUX v1.0.0.1 includes all features from previous versions
- Follow standard installation procedures in the documentation
